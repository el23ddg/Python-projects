# Python-projects
A group of projects which I am learning and building to understand and grasp better concepts. 

## 1. Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game.py
### Project Brief 📄
#### This is a simple command-line-based Python program where the user can play a round of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. It’s a fun way to practice Python programming, especially working with user input, random number generation, and control flow.
### Rules of the Game 📜
#### a) Rock (✊) beats Scissors (✌).
#### b) Scissors (✌) beat Paper (✋).
#### c) Paper (✋) beats Rock (✊).
#### d) If both the user and the computer choose the same item, it’s a tie.
### Features ✨
#### - Allows the user to choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors by entering a number (1, 2, or 3).
#### - The computer randomly selects its choice using Python's random.randint() function.
#### - Displays the user's choice and the computer's choice with corresponding emojis.
#### - Clearly determines and announces the winner or if it’s a tie.

## 2. GIF.py - Image to GIF Converter 🖼️➡️🎞️
### Project Overview 📄
#### This project demonstrates how to convert multiple image files into an animated GIF using Python and the imageio library. The provided script takes a sequence of images, combines them, and saves the result as an animated GIF. It's a simple yet effective way to bring static images to life!
### Features ✨
#### - Converts a sequence of 2 or more images into an animated GIF.
#### - Allows customization of GIF properties, such as frame duration and loop behavior.
#### - Lightweight and straightforward, powered by Python's imageio library.
### Customization 🚀
#### You can easily tweak the script for your needs:
#### a) Change frame duration: Modify the duration parameter to speed up or slow down the animation.
#### b) Change loop behavior: Set loop to 1 for a single loop or 0 for infinite looping.
