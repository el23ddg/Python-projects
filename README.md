# Python-projects
A group of projects which I am learning and building to understand and grasp better concepts. 

## 1. Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game
### Project Brief ðŸ“„
#### This is a simple command-line-based Python program where the user can play a round of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. Itâ€™s a fun way to practice Python programming, especially working with user input, random number generation, and control flow.
### Rules of the Game ðŸ“œ
#### Rock (âœŠ) beats Scissors (âœŒ).
#### Scissors (âœŒ) beat Paper (âœ‹).
#### Paper (âœ‹) beats Rock (âœŠ).
#### If both the user and the computer choose the same item, itâ€™s a tie.
### Features âœ¨
#### Allows the user to choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors by entering a number (1, 2, or 3).
#### The computer randomly selects its choice using Python's random.randint() function.
#### Displays the user's choice and the computer's choice with corresponding emojis.
#### Clearly determines and announces the winner or if itâ€™s a tie.
